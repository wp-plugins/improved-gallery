Improves the built-in gallery in WordPress 2.5 and newer.

== Description ==

This plugin improves the gallery template by making the following tweaks:

1. Puts all the gallery css in a separte file, for easy customisation and **faster page load**.
1. Adds an id attribute to the code, so that two or more galleries can have a *different* number of columns and still **display correctly** on the same page.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip "Improved Gallery" archive and put the folder into your "plugins" folder (`/wp-content/plugins/`).
1. Activate the plugin from the Plugins admin menu.

= Advanced Usage =

If you want to make it even easier to edit your gallery style, you can do this:

1. Copy the styles from 'gallery-style.css' into the main 'style.css' file in your theme (`wp-content/themes/your-theme`).
1. Edit `improved-gallery.php` and delete or comment out this line, like so:

`// add_action('template_redirect', 'improved_gallery_stylesheet');`
